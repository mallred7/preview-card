## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I worked on this project using the Live Server extension for VS Code to see my changes in realtime using a browser window with developer mode enabled to toggle between desktop and mobile viewing resolutions. Most work was done with a mobile resolution selected, changing to a desktop resolution just to make sure mobile styles weren't overly broken on a wider display.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I'd like to try to focus on optimizing the time I spend working on projects. I feel like I spent 50% of my time on this project fine-tuning the final 10% of touches to the page. I'm not sure if I need to work on getting the bulk of the project up in less time at the beginning or making more prudent edits towards the end.

I'd also like to get more comfortable with Grid. I think some of the slowdowns I experienced recoding the project were caused by figuring out how to wrestle Flexbox into doing what I wanted it to do, and I think being comfortable with Grid will help me save time in the instances that it's quicker and easier to implement than a Flexbox kludge.

### Useful resources

- ["A Complete Guide to Flexbox"](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This flexbox cheat sheet is a borderline crutch for me. Immensely helpful to the point that I struggle to commit aspects of flexbox to memory because I know I can find them here.
- [A random stackoverflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10266849/image-will-not-fill-div) - The second answer to this question (setting display to 'block') resolved an issue I was having with getting the hero image to fit the entire container it was in without leaving a small bar of space at the bottom. I set heights for everything to 100% and it didn't resolve the issue but this did. Not sure if setting the image to a block element causes any other problems but for now it works the way I want it to.

## Acknowledgments

The following is a comment on writer's block by songwriter Jason Isbell that I've taken to heart when I try to code. I think it's helped me overcome the awkwardness of putting code on the screen that I'm not 100% confident in: 

  "I do not believe in it. My job is to write, not to like what I'm writing. That's why we edit, and nobody gets editor's block".
